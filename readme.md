# Regex Match AutoSuggest Provider (Plugin for SDL Trados Studio)
Regex Match AutoSuggest Provider is an SDL Trados Studio plug-in that enables you to show AutoSuggest entries that match regular expressions specified. With this plug-in, you can, for example, enter a word or phrase that does not need to be translated, such as a model number or serial number, by selecting the regex-matched suggestion from AutoSuggest.

The released version of the plugin can be downloaded from the [plugin page](https://appstore.sdl.com/language/app/regex-match-autosuggest-provider/412/) on SDL AppStore.
